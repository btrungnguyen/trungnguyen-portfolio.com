								<p>I'm a dedicated and forward-thinking person who is currently pursuing both a Master of Science in Business in Analytic and MBA. With my interest in Finance which goes along with data technical skills, I'm committed to my education and experience to bring success for my future employers.

									My journey has lead me through a diverse positions in many company, where I've had opportunities to work closely with accounting department, applying my knowledge from data science to improve quality and results of my previous job. This experience has allowed me to develop a keen understanding of the intricacies of financial operations.
									
									My technical toolkit includes a high level of proficiency in SQL and Python, enabling me to extract, manipulate, and analyze data with precision and accuracy. <br /> However, data wrangling and manipulation could be a common skill for most data analyst, my mind is able to work with both technical site and business decision-making process, so my storytelling skill is the bridge for me to communicate the findings and connect them to the upper chain of command to improve quality and save time in decision making process.
									
									I'm excited about the opportunity to connect with fellow professionals who share a similar passion for data and analytics. Let's collaborate, share insights, and together, make data the cornerstone of smarter, more informed decision-making in the world of finance and beyond. If you're as enthusiastic about data as I am, please don't hesitate to reach out, and let's explore how we can make a meaningful impact together.</p>
